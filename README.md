# Java Unit Testing with JUnit

This repository demonstrates basic unit testing in Java using the JUnit framework. It contains simple test cases that showcase how to write, organize, and run unit tests for Java applications. The project is designed to help developers understand key concepts of testing, such as:

- Writing test methods using JUnit annotations
- Setting up test cases with `@BeforeEach` and `@AfterEach`
- Testing exceptions and edge cases
- Using assertions to validate results
